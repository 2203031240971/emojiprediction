🚀 Emoji Prediction Machine Learning Project (NLP + Streamlit + Python)

I recently built and deployed an Emoji Prediction App 🎯 using Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Streamlit.
This project takes text as input and predicts the most relevant emoji using a trained ML model.

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a fun yet powerful ML application that understands text and predicts the correct emoji using NLP techniques.

I built a dataset of 1000+ text–emoji pairs, cleaned the data, vectorized the text, and trained a machine learning classification model.

Finally, I deployed an interactive Streamlit web app where users can type any message and instantly get the predicted emoji.

🧠 Tech Stack Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy for data handling

Scikit-learn ⚙️ (TfidfVectorizer, SVM Classifier)

NLTK ✂️ for text preprocessing

Streamlit 🌐 for building the web app UI

🔧 Key Features

✨ ML-powered Emoji Prediction
✨ Custom dataset with 1000+ labeled samples
✨ NLP text cleaning + TF-IDF vectorization
✨ SVM classifier for high accuracy
✨ Real-time prediction using Streamlit
✨ Clean and modern web interface

📊 How the Model Works

Dataset Creation

Collected & structured text–emoji pairs (1000 rows).

Balanced dataset for maximum model accuracy.

Text Cleaning & Preprocessing

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Lemmatization

Vectorization

Used TF-IDF to convert text to numerical vectors.

Model Training

Trained an SVM classifier (LinearSVC)

Achieved strong accuracy on test data.

Deployment

Built an interactive Streamlit App

Users can type any sentence → model predicts an emoji in real-time.

🏁 Final Thoughts

This project helped me improve my NLP, ML, and deployment skills, and it was exciting to transform text into meaningful emoji predictions 😄.

I’m looking forward to building more ML-powered applications and exploring advanced NLP techniques like transformers (BERT, DistilBERT) in the future 🌟.
